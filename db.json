In the end, we should be able to change all the things that we dont like or can be improved in order to be a better person and improve the relationship with others (with PHP). Maybe this way Sartre changes his quote and make it 'Heaven is other people' (quote below)."

But, if I am to be bold and predict something, then it would be the stealthiness of technology. As in, the devises would be there. Your phone, your computer your TV… but unless it is being used, you wouldn’t notice it would be there. The screens, obviously transparent, or implanted on a wall or surface, but the chips would be measured in nanometers (has some already are) . The bold part of the prediction in this case will be the fact that I predicted to be wildly commercialized. If I were to compare, I guess that it would be something like how a smart TV is relevant and affordable now a days. Another not so bold prediction is that in 2025 I will be celebrating my 6th anniversary of graduation from Academia de código. "
